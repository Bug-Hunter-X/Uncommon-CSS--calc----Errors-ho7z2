The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using it, particularly when dealing with different units or incorrect operator precedence.  For example, using spaces inconsistently around operators can lead to unexpected results.  Another issue can arise from trying to combine percentages with other units in ways that are not mathematically well-defined within the CSS context.  Furthermore, nesting `calc()` expressions too deeply can lead to browser inconsistencies or performance issues.
